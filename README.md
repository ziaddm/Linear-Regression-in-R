# movie-data-regression-analysis
In this project, I used a linear regression model in R to predict movie revenue based on other movie metrics. All code was written in R using R studio.

- The PNG file contains a poster explaining the methods used and results of the model.

- The R Markdown file contains all code for the model and figures.

- A knitted html file containing code along with outputs is also included (must be downloaded to view).
